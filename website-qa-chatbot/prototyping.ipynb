God filled the hearts of this small group of believers with a desire to see Him glorified in their lives in ways that they had not seen before. \\xa0“Now to Him who is able to do exceeding abundantly beyond all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us, to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. \\xa0Amen” (Ephesians 3:20-21).\\nIn the fall of that same year, as founding Elders, Bob VanKampen and Frank Yonke, secured the property at our present location on Galusha Avenue, and the “church” began to meet. The land had originally been owned by the McCormick family. A house had been built here for a nephew of Colonel Robert McCormick but, due to complications of various sorts, he never moved in and the house sat vacant for five years. It was in the family room of this house that GCD began its first public service in January, 1985.\\nEven before deciding on an official name, the people brought two specific prayer requests before the LORD:\\nWhat we now call the \"Fireside Room\" - 1988\\nThat they would rely on the Word of God completely (it was their desire that God would grow their love for His Word, acknowledging that it is inspired by Him and without error in its original documents, and making a commitment to use Scripture as their authoritative guide in all they would do in the life and conduct of the church).\\nThat they would rely on the power of God to save His elect (it was their prayer that a God-centered Gospel would not only be preached, but would also cause this body of believers to grow to maturity, to the measure of all the fullness of Christ (Ephesians 4:13]).\\nTherefore, it was on this foundational emphasis of the amazing Grace of God in salvation that Grace Church of DuPage (GCD) came into being—emphasizing the underserved mercy of God expressed to sinners in Christ Jesus. The use of DuPage in the church’s name was intended to reflect the desire to impact not only our local community, but the entire county.\\nAnother vision for the church during the earliest days was a focus on missions.\\nBecause of some personal, God-initiated relationships, GCD was excited by the work of The Master’s Mission (TMM), an organization whose aim was to train missionaries to take the gospel to the remotest areas of the world, and survive! \\xa0The work of TMM and reports of their work in Africa fanned the flame of gospel outreach in our own area and beyond. To date, outside the US, GCD supports mission efforts in Albania, Armenia, Czech Republic, Germany, India, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Philippines, Romania, and Ukraine.\\nThe GCD body has continued to grow in numbers as a result of reaching out to the community of Warrenville and beyond with events such as an annual, fall bonfire which came to be known as The Hallelujah Party and eventually the Fall Festival. \\xa0\\xa0Many people come and enjoy good food, the spirit of fellowship, and all that comes with it. \\xa0\\xa0God’s blessing has often been seen as He uses this event to draw some to Himself. \\xa0Other avenues of community outreach currently include, AWANA, Vacation Bible School, Celebration of Christmas concerts, Ladies’ Christmas Preview, golf outings, community service projects, Sports Ministry events, children’s activities at Warrenville Summer Daze, hosting the Warrenville Youth and Family Services’ Quest program targeting at-risk kids, and the list could continue on—many, many opportunities given by God to glorify Him through the proclamation of His saving grace.\\nIt is our intention to celebrate God’s grace and the blessing of his call to each of us to love and serve him here.\\nWhat God has accomplished since the founding of GCD is precisely the focus of this celebration. \\xa0It is not our intention to celebrate buildings or grounds or the lives of very fallen people. \\xa0As He leads us forward, let us join together as we remember and rejoice in all He has done in this place. Let us also embrace what lies ahead, trusting Him to lead and guide us for His glory and our good. In fact, let us ask, seek, and knock for God to develop us into a community of worshippers that bears much fruit as we live and proclaim the Gospel with authenticity and passion.\\nLeadership History\\n Sermons by Date by Scripture by Series by Speaker by Topic Index\\nBack\\nWelcome Gather With Us What We Believe About Us Elders, Deacons, and Staff Ask the Elders Contact Us Ministries All Ministries ➝ Adult Bible Fellowships Children & Nursery College & 20s Community Groups Giving Grace Biblical Counseling Global Outreach Local Outreach Men\\'s Ministry Music & Worship Opportunities to Serve Prayer RENEW Student Ministry Short-Term GO Teams Special Needs Sports Ministry Women\\'s Ministry Events Sermons Sermons by Date by Scripture by Series by Speaker by Topic Index Stream Give\\nWe exist to magnify the worth of God by exalting the Savior, equipping the saints and extending Christ\\'s kingdom.\\nGCD Family Resources Give Serve Directories Parent\\'s Corner Blog Great Doctrines Benevolence Subscribe to Emails Quest Mentoring Cars of Hope Library Books ➝ Forms Building & Grounds Reporting CCB Login ➝\\nA Biblical Model of Leadership\\nLike many Protestant Evangelical congregations, Grace Church of DuPage is overseen by Elders and served by Deacons. But unlike many such congregations, we have labored to define these roles according to Scripture. Several passages in the Bible inform the office and operation of Elders and Deacons, including their character qualifications (1 Timothy 3:1-13; Titus 1:5-9), their responsibilities in the body (1 Peter 5:1-4; Acts 20:28), and the nature of the authority they wield (Hebrews 13:17) as gifted and called servants of God and His church (Ephesians 4:11-16).\\nLearn More \\xa0➝\\nServants & Stewards\\nIn 1 Corinthians 4:1-2 Paul speaks of church leaders as “servants” and “stewards.” Both words emphasize that our leaders are working on behalf of—or, perhaps better, under the authority of—another. The compound Greek word behind “servants” literally means “under-rowers,” calling to mind the team of men that moved ships with oars in pre-industrial times. They work together in almost synonymous harmony to achieve a purpose—the shepherding and teaching of God’s people—which no one of them could have accomplished on his own. A “steward” is one who has been entrusted with the care of someone else’s property. Church leaders, according to Paul, are “stewards of the mysteries of God,” the wide-ranging truths of the gospel that can be known only because God in His grace as revealed them.\\nIn essence, this is how we perceive our leaders at Grace Church: servants of God,\\xa0and stewards on our behalf of the mysteries of God. And we describe our responsibility using the words of the writer of Hebrews:\\n“Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you”\\n— Hebrews 13:17\\nElders\\nElders are responsible for the shepherding and the spiritual oversight of the body. \\xa0This begins with the priorities of Elders as outlined in Acts 20:28-35.\\nMeet Our Elders ➝\\nDeacons\\nThe Deacons shall consist of Grace Church members possessing the qualifications described in 1 Timothy 3:8-13. They shall be servants to the Church as they assist the Elders in the ministry of service to the Church body, which may include the overall responsibility for the general physical care of the Church facilities; for the Sunday School administrative duties; for the day to day financial oversight; and for any other duties as may be assigned to them by the Elders, from time to time.\\nMeet the Deacons ➝\\nPastoral Staff\\nFor some larger ministries, the Elders have determined that it is necessary for the shepherding and oversight of that ministry to be done by a full-time pastoral staff member. The Elders have searched for biblically qualified and gifted men to fill these roles.\\n Sermons by Date by Scripture by Series by Speaker by Topic Index\\nBack\\nWelcome Gather With Us What We Believe About Us Elders, Deacons, and Staff Ask the Elders Contact Us Ministries All Ministries ➝ Adult Bible Fellowships Children & Nursery College & 20s Community Groups Giving Grace Biblical Counseling Global Outreach Local Outreach Men\\'s Ministry Music & Worship Opportunities to Serve Prayer RENEW Student Ministry Short-Term GO Teams Special Needs Sports Ministry Women\\'s Ministry Events Sermons Sermons by Date by Scripture by Series by Speaker by Topic Index Stream Give\\nWe exist to magnify the worth of God by exalting the Savior, equipping the saints and extending Christ\\'s kingdom.\\nGCD Family Resources Give Serve Directories Parent\\'s Corner Blog Great Doctrines Benevolence Subscribe to Emails Quest Mentoring Cars of Hope Library Books ➝ Forms Building & Grounds Reporting CCB Login ➝\\nPastoral Ministries\\nWhat we believe the Bible teaches about the vision and aim for pastoral ministry in the local church and how that vision is applied in our specific context at Grace Church of DuPage.\\nAbout\\nIn his first century letter to the Ephesians, chapter four, the Apostle Paul laid out a clear vision for the aim pastoral ministry in the local church (Ephesians 4:11-16 ESV):\\nJesus Christ “ ...gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes. Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.”\\nDefined & Applied\\nWhat does this mean? In summary, the exercise of certain God-given gifts within the fellowship of the local Christian community enables believers to grow together toward spiritual maturity, stability, unity, and love as they serve God and one another toward an ever-deepening understanding of and engagement in the truths of the Christian faith.\\nThat is what pastoral ministry is supposed to produce: mature Christ-followers who love one another and are active in service together. And the pastoral ministry portion of the list of gifts Paul enumerated in Ephesians 4:11 are the last two items: “shepherds and teachers.”\\nTEACHERS\\n“Teachers” we understand: they explain biblical truth, theology, missions training, even biblical counseling and principles of discipleship in practical areas like personal holiness, marriage, family, parenting, and so forth, using trusted resources that are rooted in Scripture and expressive of sound doctrine.\\nSHEPHERDS\\n“Shepherds” is the interesting word. It is sometimes translated “pastors.” Pastors feed and care for God’s people, the “flock,” in a ways that are analogous to shepherds tending sheep. God does not want His people to be sheep without a shepherd (see Ezekiel 34). Therefore, Paul is telling us in Ephesians 4 that He has uniquely equipped certain people in the church to serve as “shepherds” so that His people will have the sort of teaching and leadership and care that He has intended for them. And as the shepherd’s operate within that enabling God supplies, His people mature in community just as He has intended.\\nAPPLICATION\\nAt Grace Church of DuPage we take pastoral ministry very seriously. Biblical teaching happens not only in our Sunday Worship Services, but also within the context of personal relationships in our Sunday morning Adult Bible Fellowships,\\xa0Youth Ministry, and Children’s Sunday School,\\xa0Wednesday Evening Lessons & Prayer and AWANA Clubs for children, our weekly/monthly FLOCKS gatherings in people’s homes, and also in our various types of and Small Groups, including Ladies Bible Study,\\xa0Ladies Prayer, and Men’s Small Groups.\\nCaring for one another at Grace Church also happens in different ways. As there are physical needs in the our body, our Care and Share ministry springs into action. And our Deacons can assist at times of financial need as they steward our Benevolence Fund.

It explains why we were created and what’s wrong with us. It explains why this world is so messed up and what God is doing to fix it. It is about the turning point of history: when a Jewish man from Nazareth walked out of his own tomb alive 2,000 years ago. And it’s about how that day marked the beginning of the renewal of all things.\\nCreation: The World As It Should Be\\nGod created the world and everything in it in order to put himself – his goodness, beauty, love, and wisdom – on display for us to enjoy. As our maker, he is our loving and trustworthy ruler who owns us and provides for all our needs. We were made to know him joyfully and to rule the world under his authority.\\nRebellion: What Went Wrong\\nAlthough God created all things good, the world is in shambles because we rejected him and his rule. Our first parents, Adam and Eve, were rebels and didn’t trust God. Because of this, God cursed the whole world and sent them away from his presence. We all live for our glory instead of God’s and we treasure the things God gives us while rejecting him as the gracious giver. Sometimes we try to add a little religion to our lives to offset our guilt, but we can’t fix our problem. God is dishonored and we are miserable. “For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him” ( Romans 1:23 ).\\nRedemption: What God Does For Us\\nBut God, because of his great grace, lovingly refuses to give us what we deserve. The gospel is the good news that God is on a rescue mission to reestablish his loving reign and restore all things. Jesus Christ lived the faithful life that we should have lived. He died the guilty death we deserve to die. Then he rose to new life so that we could also be made alive with him. He is now enthroned over all things and will come again to overthrow evil completely, renew the cursed creation, and raise his people from the dead to enjoy living with him forever. Because he died for our sins, we can be forgiven and restored to find our joy in knowing God. “For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God” ( 1 Peter 3:18 ).\\nResponse: What We Must Do\\nThis gospel calls us to admit that we’re more sinful and flawed than we could ever believe, and yet, because of Christ, we’re more loved and welcomed than we could ever hope. We deserve the punishment of hell for our rebellion against God, and yet, because Christ took it, there is now no condemnation for those who trust him. None. Ever. This means we must turn away from our rebellious disobedience as well as our prideful obedience. We let go of our bad works and our good works and trust only in Christ’s work. “To all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God” ( John 1:12 ).\\nWill you receive Jesus Christ and rejoice in his work for you? “We also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation” ( Romans 5:11 ).\\n Sermons by Date by Scripture by Series by Speaker by Topic Index\\nBack\\nWelcome Gather With Us What We Believe About Us Elders, Deacons, and Staff Ask the Elders Contact Us Ministries All Ministries ➝ Adult Bible Fellowships Children & Nursery College & 20s Community Groups Giving Grace Biblical Counseling Global Outreach Local Outreach Men\\'s Ministry Music & Worship Opportunities to Serve Prayer RENEW Student Ministry Short-Term GO Teams Special Needs Sports Ministry Women\\'s Ministry Events Sermons Sermons by Date by Scripture by Series by Speaker by Topic Index Stream Give\\nWe exist to magnify the worth of God by exalting the Savior, equipping the saints and extending Christ\\'s kingdom.\\nOur Purpose, Vision, and Values\\nOur Purpose\\nWe exist to magnify the worth of God by exalting our Savior, equipping the saints, and extending Christ\\'s kingdom.\\nHow are we seeking god to carry out this purpose in us?\\nWe encourage you seek the Lord and his leading and as we do that together, we ask you to commit to involvement in one of each of of these areas: corporate worship, small gathering, in-church service, and outreach.\\nCORPORATE WORSHIP\\nTo experience God’s presence and work, hear his welcome and word, and respond with worship, prayer, and thanksgiving.\\nAnd they devoted themselves to the apostles\\' teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers.

But unlike many such congregations, we have labored to define these roles according to Scripture. Several passages in the Bible inform the office and operation of Elders and Deacons, including their character qualifications (1 Timothy 3:1-13; Titus 1:5-9), their responsibilities in the body (1 Peter 5:1-4; Acts 20:28), and the nature of the authority they wield (Hebrews 13:17) as gifted and called servants of God and His church (Ephesians 4:11-16).\\n Download Baptism & Membership Application ➝\\nMembership Induction at Grace Church of DuPage\\nThe following is the pattern developed in our Constitution by our Elders,\\xa0that the Membership induction service follows. \\xa0Covenantal questions are read aloud, and candidates for Membership respond aloud before God and the congregation with a hearty \"I do\". \\xa0Then, current Members and candidates recite aloud in unison the Church Covenant. \\xa0Finally, the pastor closes us in prayer.\\nPastoral Exhortation and Excerpt from the Constitution on Membership\\nThe pastor reads an excerpt from the GCD Constitution re: the purpose of Membership and gives words of encouragement to current Members and candidates about the significance of being a Member of a local congregation.\\xa0 He also reminds everyone about the benefits of Membership such as expanded ministry opportunities, increased commitment and accountability, along with the protection and leadership of qualified Church Elders. Finally, he states our thanks to God for them and their desire to commit to the worship, fellowship, and service within our own local assembly of believers.\\nCovenantal Questions\\nThe candidates will respond with a hearty “ I do” to each of these questions.\\nDo you confess Jesus Christ as your Savior and Lord?\\nDo you accept the Holy Scriptures, the Old and New Testaments, as the authoritative and infallible Word of God?\\nDo you commit to live among God’s faithful people by hearing His Word, sharing His Supper, and proclaiming,\\xa0through your words and deeds, the good news of salvation by God’s grace through faith in Christ?\\nDo you also promise to support the ministries of this Church with your prayers, your presence, your participation,\\xa0and your provision as God would permit?\\nChurch Covenant Recited in Unison by Current Members and Candidates\\nHaving been led by the Spirit of God to receive Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord, and having made public confession of our faith through Baptism to show our identification with Christ; we freely and joyfully enter into a Covenant with one another as one body in Christ, seeking the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.\\nWe pledge, therefore, by the aid of God’s Spirit, to live together in Christian love by exercising an affectionate care and watchfulness over one another, and faithfully encouraging and admonishing one another in the faith. We will rejoice with each other’s joys and bear one another’s burdens with tenderness and grace.\\nWe pledge to work for the advancement of God’s kingdom through His Church by the spiritual disciplines of the Word, prayer, evangelism, worship, and fellowship. We also promise to sustain its Ordinances and doctrines, and to support its ministry by a faithful stewardship of our money through cheerful and regular giving, and with the devoted use of our time and giftedness; thus to spread the Gospel through all the nations.\\nWe further pledge to follow Christian principles of morality in our daily lives; being ethical in our dealings and faithful in our commitments, and denying ungodliness and worldly lusts in our pursuit of holy living. We will strive for Christlikeness in ourselves and in our families.\\nMay the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with us all.\\nAmen.\\nClosing Prayer\\nPraise God that He is building His Church, and pray for Grace Church that we would love and care for the new Members, and protect and equip them. Also, pray for the new Members to grow in grace and knowledge of our Lord Jesus.\\n\\n                                                Answer: \\n                                            '}}>]"

God filled the hearts of this small group of believers with a desire to see Him glorified in their lives in ways that they had not seen before. \\xa0“Now to Him who is able to do exceeding abundantly beyond all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us, to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. \\xa0Amen” (Ephesians 3:20-21).\\nIn the fall of that same year, as founding Elders, Bob VanKampen and Frank Yonke, secured the property at our present location on Galusha Avenue, and the “church” began to meet. The land had originally been owned by the McCormick family. A house had been built here for a nephew of Colonel Robert McCormick but, due to complications of various sorts, he never moved in and the house sat vacant for five years. It was in the family room of this house that GCD began its first public service in January, 1985.\\nEven before deciding on an official name, the people brought two specific prayer requests before the LORD:\\nWhat we now call the \"Fireside Room\" - 1988\\nThat they would rely on the Word of God completely (it was their desire that God would grow their love for His Word, acknowledging that it is inspired by Him and without error in its original documents, and making a commitment to use Scripture as their authoritative guide in all they would do in the life and conduct of the church).\\nThat they would rely on the power of God to save His elect (it was their prayer that a God-centered Gospel would not only be preached, but would also cause this body of believers to grow to maturity, to the measure of all the fullness of Christ (Ephesians 4:13]).\\nTherefore, it was on this foundational emphasis of the amazing Grace of God in salvation that Grace Church of DuPage (GCD) came into being—emphasizing the underserved mercy of God expressed to sinners in Christ Jesus. The use of DuPage in the church’s name was intended to reflect the desire to impact not only our local community, but the entire county.\\nAnother vision for the church during the earliest days was a focus on missions.\\nBecause of some personal, God-initiated relationships, GCD was excited by the work of The Master’s Mission (TMM), an organization whose aim was to train missionaries to take the gospel to the remotest areas of the world, and survive! \\xa0The work of TMM and reports of their work in Africa fanned the flame of gospel outreach in our own area and beyond. To date, outside the US, GCD supports mission efforts in Albania, Armenia, Czech Republic, Germany, India, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Philippines, Romania, and Ukraine.\\nThe GCD body has continued to grow in numbers as a result of reaching out to the community of Warrenville and beyond with events such as an annual, fall bonfire which came to be known as The Hallelujah Party and eventually the Fall Festival. \\xa0\\xa0Many people come and enjoy good food, the spirit of fellowship, and all that comes with it. \\xa0\\xa0God’s blessing has often been seen as He uses this event to draw some to Himself. \\xa0Other avenues of community outreach currently include, AWANA, Vacation Bible School, Celebration of Christmas concerts, Ladies’ Christmas Preview, golf outings, community service projects, Sports Ministry events, children’s activities at Warrenville Summer Daze, hosting the Warrenville Youth and Family Services’ Quest program targeting at-risk kids, and the list could continue on—many, many opportunities given by God to glorify Him through the proclamation of His saving grace.\\nIt is our intention to celebrate God’s grace and the blessing of his call to each of us to love and serve him here.\\nWhat God has accomplished since the founding of GCD is precisely the focus of this celebration. \\xa0It is not our intention to celebrate buildings or grounds or the lives of very fallen people. \\xa0As He leads us forward, let us join together as we remember and rejoice in all He has done in this place. Let us also embrace what lies ahead, trusting Him to lead and guide us for His glory and our good. In fact, let us ask, seek, and knock for God to develop us into a community of worshippers that bears much fruit as we live and proclaim the Gospel with authenticity and passion.\\nLeadership History\\n Sermons by Date by Scripture by Series by Speaker by Topic Index\\nBack\\nWelcome Gather With Us What We Believe About Us Elders, Deacons, and Staff Ask the Elders Contact Us Ministries All Ministries ➝ Adult Bible Fellowships Children & Nursery College & 20s Community Groups Giving Grace Biblical Counseling Global Outreach Local Outreach Men\\'s Ministry Music & Worship Opportunities to Serve Prayer RENEW Student Ministry Short-Term GO Teams Special Needs Sports Ministry Women\\'s Ministry Events Sermons Sermons by Date by Scripture by Series by Speaker by Topic Index Stream Give\\nWe exist to magnify the worth of God by exalting the Savior, equipping the saints and extending Christ\\'s kingdom.\\nGCD Family Resources Give Serve Directories Parent\\'s Corner Blog Great Doctrines Benevolence Subscribe to Emails Quest Mentoring Cars of Hope Library Books ➝ Forms Building & Grounds Reporting CCB Login ➝\\nA Biblical Model of Leadership\\nLike many Protestant Evangelical congregations, Grace Church of DuPage is overseen by Elders and served by Deacons. But unlike many such congregations, we have labored to define these roles according to Scripture. Several passages in the Bible inform the office and operation of Elders and Deacons, including their character qualifications (1 Timothy 3:1-13; Titus 1:5-9), their responsibilities in the body (1 Peter 5:1-4; Acts 20:28), and the nature of the authority they wield (Hebrews 13:17) as gifted and called servants of God and His church (Ephesians 4:11-16).\\nLearn More \\xa0➝\\nServants & Stewards\\nIn 1 Corinthians 4:1-2 Paul speaks of church leaders as “servants” and “stewards.” Both words emphasize that our leaders are working on behalf of—or, perhaps better, under the authority of—another. The compound Greek word behind “servants” literally means “under-rowers,” calling to mind the team of men that moved ships with oars in pre-industrial times. They work together in almost synonymous harmony to achieve a purpose—the shepherding and teaching of God’s people—which no one of them could have accomplished on his own. A “steward” is one who has been entrusted with the care of someone else’s property. Church leaders, according to Paul, are “stewards of the mysteries of God,” the wide-ranging truths of the gospel that can be known only because God in His grace as revealed them.\\nIn essence, this is how we perceive our leaders at Grace Church: servants of God,\\xa0and stewards on our behalf of the mysteries of God. And we describe our responsibility using the words of the writer of Hebrews:\\n“Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you”\\n— Hebrews 13:17\\nElders\\nElders are responsible for the shepherding and the spiritual oversight of the body. \\xa0This begins with the priorities of Elders as outlined in Acts 20:28-35.\\nMeet Our Elders ➝\\nDeacons\\nThe Deacons shall consist of Grace Church members possessing the qualifications described in 1 Timothy 3:8-13. They shall be servants to the Church as they assist the Elders in the ministry of service to the Church body, which may include the overall responsibility for the general physical care of the Church facilities; for the Sunday School administrative duties; for the day to day financial oversight; and for any other duties as may be assigned to them by the Elders, from time to time.\\nMeet the Deacons ➝\\nPastoral Staff\\nFor some larger ministries, the Elders have determined that it is necessary for the shepherding and oversight of that ministry to be done by a full-time pastoral staff member. The Elders have searched for biblically qualified and gifted men to fill these roles.\\n Sermons by Date by Scripture by Series by Speaker by Topic Index\\nBack\\nWelcome Gather With Us What We Believe About Us Elders, Deacons, and Staff Ask the Elders Contact Us Ministries All Ministries ➝ Adult Bible Fellowships Children & Nursery College & 20s Community Groups Giving Grace Biblical Counseling Global Outreach Local Outreach Men\\'s Ministry Music & Worship Opportunities to Serve Prayer RENEW Student Ministry Short-Term GO Teams Special Needs Sports Ministry Women\\'s Ministry Events Sermons Sermons by Date by Scripture by Series by Speaker by Topic Index Stream Give\\nWe exist to magnify the worth of God by exalting the Savior, equipping the saints and extending Christ\\'s kingdom.\\nGCD Family Resources Give Serve Directories Parent\\'s Corner Blog Great Doctrines Benevolence Subscribe to Emails Quest Mentoring Cars of Hope Library Books ➝ Forms Building & Grounds Reporting CCB Login ➝\\nPastoral Ministries\\nWhat we believe the Bible teaches about the vision and aim for pastoral ministry in the local church and how that vision is applied in our specific context at Grace Church of DuPage.\\nAbout\\nIn his first century letter to the Ephesians, chapter four, the Apostle Paul laid out a clear vision for the aim pastoral ministry in the local church (Ephesians 4:11-16 ESV):\\nJesus Christ “ ...gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes. Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.”\\nDefined & Applied\\nWhat does this mean? In summary, the exercise of certain God-given gifts within the fellowship of the local Christian community enables believers to grow together toward spiritual maturity, stability, unity, and love as they serve God and one another toward an ever-deepening understanding of and engagement in the truths of the Christian faith.\\nThat is what pastoral ministry is supposed to produce: mature Christ-followers who love one another and are active in service together. And the pastoral ministry portion of the list of gifts Paul enumerated in Ephesians 4:11 are the last two items: “shepherds and teachers.”\\nTEACHERS\\n“Teachers” we understand: they explain biblical truth, theology, missions training, even biblical counseling and principles of discipleship in practical areas like personal holiness, marriage, family, parenting, and so forth, using trusted resources that are rooted in Scripture and expressive of sound doctrine.\\nSHEPHERDS\\n“Shepherds” is the interesting word. It is sometimes translated “pastors.” Pastors feed and care for God’s people, the “flock,” in a ways that are analogous to shepherds tending sheep. God does not want His people to be sheep without a shepherd (see Ezekiel 34). Therefore, Paul is telling us in Ephesians 4 that He has uniquely equipped certain people in the church to serve as “shepherds” so that His people will have the sort of teaching and leadership and care that He has intended for them. And as the shepherd’s operate within that enabling God supplies, His people mature in community just as He has intended.\\nAPPLICATION\\nAt Grace Church of DuPage we take pastoral ministry very seriously. Biblical teaching happens not only in our Sunday Worship Services, but also within the context of personal relationships in our Sunday morning Adult Bible Fellowships,\\xa0Youth Ministry, and Children’s Sunday School,\\xa0Wednesday Evening Lessons & Prayer and AWANA Clubs for children, our weekly/monthly FLOCKS gatherings in people’s homes, and also in our various types of and Small Groups, including Ladies Bible Study,\\xa0Ladies Prayer, and Men’s Small Groups.\\nCaring for one another at Grace Church also happens in different ways. As there are physical needs in the our body, our Care and Share ministry springs into action. And our Deacons can assist at times of financial need as they steward our Benevolence Fund. Our Grace Biblical Counseling Ministry is available for Pre-marriage and Marriage Counseling as well as Biblical Counseling regarding a wide range of personal issues. Our staff also provides Pastoral Counseling as requested. And when we lose loved ones, our Bereavement Ministry can help in some limited, but very tangible ways.\\nGrace Church is also forward-looking in areas of pastoral ministry, providing training and practical experience in a number of different ways through our Elder Preparation Program,\\xa0Pastoral Ministry Training Apprenticeship, Women’s Ministry Training Apprenticeship, Music Ministry Training Apprenticeship, and our Missionary Preparation Program.\\n Sermons by Date by Scripture by Series by Speaker by Topic Index\\nBack\\nWelcome Gather With Us What We Believe About Us Elders, Deacons, and Staff Ask the Elders Contact Us Ministries All Ministries ➝ Adult Bible Fellowships Children & Nursery College & 20s Community Groups Giving Grace Biblical Counseling Global Outreach Local Outreach Men\\'s Ministry Music & Worship Opportunities to Serve Prayer RENEW Student Ministry Short-Term GO Teams Special Needs Sports Ministry Women\\'s Ministry Events Sermons Sermons by Date by Scripture by Series by Speaker by Topic Index Stream Give\\nWe exist to magnify the worth of God by exalting the Savior, equipping the saints and extending Christ\\'s kingdom.\\nGCD Family Resources Give Serve Directories Parent\\'s Corner Blog Great Doctrines Benevolence Subscribe to Emails Quest Mentoring Cars of Hope Library Books ➝ Forms Building & Grounds Reporting CCB Login ➝\\nWho Is Jesus\\nThe message of Christianity is about God, the World, and you and me.\\xa0 It\\'s the story to which all other stories point.\\xa0 It is about the meaning of life, the search for joy, and hope in the face of death.

As our maker, he is our loving and trustworthy ruler who owns us and provides for all our needs. We were made to know him joyfully and to rule the world under his authority.\\nRebellion: What Went Wrong\\nAlthough God created all things good, the world is in shambles because we rejected him and his rule. Our first parents, Adam and Eve, were rebels and didn’t trust God. Because of this, God cursed the whole world and sent them away from his presence. We all live for our glory instead of God’s and we treasure the things God gives us while rejecting him as the gracious giver. Sometimes we try to add a little religion to our lives to offset our guilt, but we can’t fix our problem. God is dishonored and we are miserable. “For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him” ( Romans 1:23 ).\\nRedemption: What God Does For Us\\nBut God, because of his great grace, lovingly refuses to give us what we deserve. The gospel is the good news that God is on a rescue mission to reestablish his loving reign and restore all things. Jesus Christ lived the faithful life that we should have lived. He died the guilty death we deserve to die. Then he rose to new life so that we could also be made alive with him. He is now enthroned over all things and will come again to overthrow evil completely, renew the cursed creation, and raise his people from the dead to enjoy living with him forever. Because he died for our sins, we can be forgiven and restored to find our joy in knowing God. “For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God” ( 1 Peter 3:18 ).\\nResponse: What We Must Do\\nThis gospel calls us to admit that we’re more sinful and flawed than we could ever believe, and yet, because of Christ, we’re more loved and welcomed than we could ever hope. We deserve the punishment of hell for our rebellion against God, and yet, because Christ took it, there is now no condemnation for those who trust him. None. Ever. This means we must turn away from our rebellious disobedience as well as our prideful obedience. We let go of our bad works and our good works and trust only in Christ’s work. “To all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God” ( John 1:12 ).\\nWill you receive Jesus Christ and rejoice in his work for you? “We also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation” ( Romans 5:11 ).\\n Sermons by Date by Scripture by Series by Speaker by Topic Index\\nBack\\nWelcome Gather With Us What We Believe About Us Elders, Deacons, and Staff Ask the Elders Contact Us Ministries All Ministries ➝ Adult Bible Fellowships Children & Nursery College & 20s Community Groups Giving Grace Biblical Counseling Global Outreach Local Outreach Men\\'s Ministry Music & Worship Opportunities to Serve Prayer RENEW Student Ministry Short-Term GO Teams Special Needs Sports Ministry Women\\'s Ministry Events Sermons Sermons by Date by Scripture by Series by Speaker by Topic Index Stream Give\\nWe exist to magnify the worth of God by exalting the Savior, equipping the saints and extending Christ\\'s kingdom.\\nOur Purpose, Vision, and Values\\nOur Purpose\\nWe exist to magnify the worth of God by exalting our Savior, equipping the saints, and extending Christ\\'s kingdom.\\nHow are we seeking god to carry out this purpose in us?\\nWe encourage you seek the Lord and his leading and as we do that together, we ask you to commit to involvement in one of each of of these areas: corporate worship, small gathering, in-church service, and outreach.\\nCORPORATE WORSHIP\\nTo experience God’s presence and work, hear his welcome and word, and respond with worship, prayer, and thanksgiving.\\nAnd they devoted themselves to the apostles\\' teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers.

But unlike many such congregations, we have labored to define these roles according to Scripture. Several passages in the Bible inform the office and operation of Elders and Deacons, including their character qualifications (1 Timothy 3:1-13; Titus 1:5-9), their responsibilities in the body (1 Peter 5:1-4; Acts 20:28), and the nature of the authority they wield (Hebrews 13:17) as gifted and called servants of God and His church (Ephesians 4:11-16).\\n Download Baptism & Membership Application ➝\\nMembership Induction at Grace Church of DuPage\\nThe following is the pattern developed in our Constitution by our Elders,\\xa0that the Membership induction service follows. \\xa0Covenantal questions are read aloud, and candidates for Membership respond aloud before God and the congregation with a hearty \"I do\". \\xa0Then, current Members and candidates recite aloud in unison the Church Covenant. \\xa0Finally, the pastor closes us in prayer.\\nPastoral Exhortation and Excerpt from the Constitution on Membership\\nThe pastor reads an excerpt from the GCD Constitution re: the purpose of Membership and gives words of encouragement to current Members and candidates about the significance of being a Member of a local congregation.\\xa0 He also reminds everyone about the benefits of Membership such as expanded ministry opportunities, increased commitment and accountability, along with the protection and leadership of qualified Church Elders. Finally, he states our thanks to God for them and their desire to commit to the worship, fellowship, and service within our own local assembly of believers.\\nCovenantal Questions\\nThe candidates will respond with a hearty “ I do” to each of these questions.\\nDo you confess Jesus Christ as your Savior and Lord?\\nDo you accept the Holy Scriptures, the Old and New Testaments, as the authoritative and infallible Word of God?\\nDo you commit to live among God’s faithful people by hearing His Word, sharing His Supper, and proclaiming,\\xa0through your words and deeds, the good news of salvation by God’s grace through faith in Christ?\\nDo you also promise to support the ministries of this Church with your prayers, your presence, your participation,\\xa0and your provision as God would permit?\\nChurch Covenant Recited in Unison by Current Members and Candidates\\nHaving been led by the Spirit of God to receive Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord, and having made public confession of our faith through Baptism to show our identification with Christ; we freely and joyfully enter into a Covenant with one another as one body in Christ, seeking the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.\\nWe pledge, therefore, by the aid of God’s Spirit, to live together in Christian love by exercising an affectionate care and watchfulness over one another, and faithfully encouraging and admonishing one another in the faith. We will rejoice with each other’s joys and bear one another’s burdens with tenderness and grace.\\nWe pledge to work for the advancement of God’s kingdom through His Church by the spiritual disciplines of the Word, prayer, evangelism, worship, and fellowship. We also promise to sustain its Ordinances and doctrines, and to support its ministry by a faithful stewardship of our money through cheerful and regular giving, and with the devoted use of our time and giftedness; thus to spread the Gospel through all the nations.\\nWe further pledge to follow Christian principles of morality in our daily lives; being ethical in our dealings and faithful in our commitments, and denying ungodliness and worldly lusts in our pursuit of holy living. We will strive for Christlikeness in ourselves and in our families.\\nMay the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with us all.\\nAmen.\\nClosing Prayer\\nPraise God that He is building His Church, and pray for Grace Church that we would love and care for the new Members, and protect and equip them.

God filled the hearts of this small group of believers with a desire to see Him glorified in their lives in ways that they had not seen before. \\xa0“Now to Him who is able to do exceeding abundantly beyond all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us, to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. \\xa0Amen” (Ephesians 3:20-21).\\nIn the fall of that same year, as founding Elders, Bob VanKampen and Frank Yonke, secured the property at our present location on Galusha Avenue, and the “church” began to meet. The land had originally been owned by the McCormick family. A house had been built here for a nephew of Colonel Robert McCormick but, due to complications of various sorts, he never moved in and the house sat vacant for five years. It was in the family room of this house that GCD began its first public service in January, 1985.\\nEven before deciding on an official name, the people brought two specific prayer requests before the LORD:\\nWhat we now call the \"Fireside Room\" - 1988\\nThat they would rely on the Word of God completely (it was their desire that God would grow their love for His Word, acknowledging that it is inspired by Him and without error in its original documents, and making a commitment to use Scripture as their authoritative guide in all they would do in the life and conduct of the church).\\nThat they would rely on the power of God to save His elect (it was their prayer that a God-centered Gospel would not only be preached, but would also cause this body of believers to grow to maturity, to the measure of all the fullness of Christ (Ephesians 4:13]).\\nTherefore, it was on this foundational emphasis of the amazing Grace of God in salvation that Grace Church of DuPage (GCD) came into being—emphasizing the underserved mercy of God expressed to sinners in Christ Jesus. The use of DuPage in the church’s name was intended to reflect the desire to impact not only our local community, but the entire county.\\nAnother vision for the church during the earliest days was a focus on missions.\\nBecause of some personal, God-initiated relationships, GCD was excited by the work of The Master’s Mission (TMM), an organization whose aim was to train missionaries to take the gospel to the remotest areas of the world, and survive! \\xa0The work of TMM and reports of their work in Africa fanned the flame of gospel outreach in our own area and beyond. To date, outside the US, GCD supports mission efforts in Albania, Armenia, Czech Republic, Germany, India, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Philippines, Romania, and Ukraine.\\nThe GCD body has continued to grow in numbers as a result of reaching out to the community of Warrenville and beyond with events such as an annual, fall bonfire which came to be known as The Hallelujah Party and eventually the Fall Festival. \\xa0\\xa0Many people come and enjoy good food, the spirit of fellowship, and all that comes with it. \\xa0\\xa0God’s blessing has often been seen as He uses this event to draw some to Himself. \\xa0Other avenues of community outreach currently include, AWANA, Vacation Bible School, Celebration of Christmas concerts, Ladies’ Christmas Preview, golf outings, community service projects, Sports Ministry events, children’s activities at Warrenville Summer Daze, hosting the Warrenville Youth and Family Services’ Quest program targeting at-risk kids, and the list could continue on—many, many opportunities given by God to glorify Him through the proclamation of His saving grace.\\nIt is our intention to celebrate God’s grace and the blessing of his call to each of us to love and serve him here.\\nWhat God has accomplished since the founding of GCD is precisely the focus of this celebration. \\xa0It is not our intention to celebrate buildings or grounds or the lives of very fallen people. \\xa0As He leads us forward, let us join together as we remember and rejoice in all He has done in this place. Let us also embrace what lies ahead, trusting Him to lead and guide us for His glory and our good. In fact, let us ask, seek, and knock for God to develop us into a community of worshippers that bears much fruit as we live and proclaim the Gospel with authenticity and passion.\\nLeadership History\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.6691751237081842, 'meta': {'url': 'https://www.gracedupage.org/history', 'timestamp': 1697085018, 'vector_id': '0'}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': '<embedding of shape (768,)>', 'id': '387fbf3c6f3e17c261aa08b41b5a1f4a'}>,\n",

The compound Greek word behind “servants” literally means “under-rowers,” calling to mind the team of men that moved ships with oars in pre-industrial times. They work together in almost synonymous harmony to achieve a purpose—the shepherding and teaching of God’s people—which no one of them could have accomplished on his own. A “steward” is one who has been entrusted with the care of someone else’s property. Church leaders, according to Paul, are “stewards of the mysteries of God,” the wide-ranging truths of the gospel that can be known only because God in His grace as revealed them.\\nIn essence, this is how we perceive our leaders at Grace Church: servants of God,\\xa0and stewards on our behalf of the mysteries of God. And we describe our responsibility using the words of the writer of Hebrews:\\n“Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you”\\n— Hebrews 13:17\\nElders\\nElders are responsible for the shepherding and the spiritual oversight of the body. \\xa0This begins with the priorities of Elders as outlined in Acts 20:28-35.\\nMeet Our Elders ➝\\nDeacons\\nThe Deacons shall consist of Grace Church members possessing the qualifications described in 1 Timothy 3:8-13. They shall be servants to the Church as they assist the Elders in the ministry of service to the Church body, which may include the overall responsibility for the general physical care of the Church facilities; for the Sunday School administrative duties; for the day to day financial oversight; and for any other duties as may be assigned to them by the Elders, from time to time.\\nMeet the Deacons ➝\\nPastoral Staff\\nFor some larger ministries, the Elders have determined that it is necessary for the shepherding and oversight of that ministry to be done by a full-time pastoral staff member. The Elders have searched for biblically qualified and gifted men to fill these roles.\\n\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.6642364146443062, 'meta': {'url': 'https://www.gracedupage.org/leadership', 'timestamp': 1697085019, 'vector_id': '5'}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': '<embedding of shape (768,)>', 'id': 'c76ee9bcae4bb2c2bd47296fefa0ad4a'}>,\n",

Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.”\\nDefined & Applied\\nWhat does this mean? In summary, the exercise of certain God-given gifts within the fellowship of the local Christian community enables believers to grow together toward spiritual maturity, stability, unity, and love as they serve God and one another toward an ever-deepening understanding of and engagement in the truths of the Christian faith.\\nThat is what pastoral ministry is supposed to produce: mature Christ-followers who love one another and are active in service together. And the pastoral ministry portion of the list of gifts Paul enumerated in Ephesians 4:11 are the last two items: “shepherds and teachers.”\\nTEACHERS\\n“Teachers” we understand: they explain biblical truth, theology, missions training, even biblical counseling and principles of discipleship in practical areas like personal holiness, marriage, family, parenting, and so forth, using trusted resources that are rooted in Scripture and expressive of sound doctrine.\\nSHEPHERDS\\n“Shepherds” is the interesting word. It is sometimes translated “pastors.” Pastors feed and care for God’s people, the “flock,” in a ways that are analogous to shepherds tending sheep. God does not want His people to be sheep without a shepherd (see Ezekiel 34). Therefore, Paul is telling us in Ephesians 4 that He has uniquely equipped certain people in the church to serve as “shepherds” so that His people will have the sort of teaching and leadership and care that He has intended for them. And as the shepherd’s operate within that enabling God supplies, His people mature in community just as He has intended.\\nAPPLICATION\\nAt Grace Church of DuPage we take pastoral ministry very seriously. Biblical teaching happens not only in our Sunday Worship Services, but also within the context of personal relationships in our Sunday morning Adult Bible Fellowships,\\xa0Youth Ministry, and Children’s Sunday School,\\xa0Wednesday Evening Lessons & Prayer and AWANA Clubs for children, our weekly/monthly FLOCKS gatherings in people’s homes, and also in our various types of and Small Groups, including Ladies Bible Study,\\xa0Ladies Prayer, and Men’s Small Groups.\\nCaring for one another at Grace Church also happens in different ways. As there are physical needs in the our body, our Care and Share ministry springs into action. And our Deacons can assist at times of financial need as they steward our Benevolence Fund. Our Grace Biblical Counseling Ministry is available for Pre-marriage and Marriage Counseling as well as Biblical Counseling regarding a wide range of personal issues. Our staff also provides Pastoral Counseling as requested. And when we lose loved ones, our Bereavement Ministry can help in some limited, but very tangible ways.\\nGrace Church is also forward-looking in areas of pastoral ministry, providing training and practical experience in a number of different ways through our Elder Preparation Program,\\xa0Pastoral Ministry Training Apprenticeship, Women’s Ministry Training Apprenticeship, Music Ministry Training Apprenticeship, and our Missionary Preparation Program.\\n\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.6625416189349265, 'meta': {'url': 'https://www.gracedupage.org/pastoral-ministries', 'timestamp': 1697085019, 'vector_id': '3'}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': '<embedding of shape (768,)>', 'id': 'aa16e70e066c17c15778ef504d0ddd57'}>,\n",

It explains why we were created and what’s wrong with us. It explains why this world is so messed up and what God is doing to fix it. It is about the turning point of history: when a Jewish man from Nazareth walked out of his own tomb alive 2,000 years ago. And it’s about how that day marked the beginning of the renewal of all things.\\nCreation: The World As It Should Be\\nGod created the world and everything in it in order to put himself – his goodness, beauty, love, and wisdom – on display for us to enjoy. As our maker, he is our loving and trustworthy ruler who owns us and provides for all our needs. We were made to know him joyfully and to rule the world under his authority.\\nRebellion: What Went Wrong\\nAlthough God created all things good, the world is in shambles because we rejected him and his rule. Our first parents, Adam and Eve, were rebels and didn’t trust God. Because of this, God cursed the whole world and sent them away from his presence. We all live for our glory instead of God’s and we treasure the things God gives us while rejecting him as the gracious giver. Sometimes we try to add a little religion to our lives to offset our guilt, but we can’t fix our problem. God is dishonored and we are miserable. “For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him” ( Romans 1:23 ).\\nRedemption: What God Does For Us\\nBut God, because of his great grace, lovingly refuses to give us what we deserve. The gospel is the good news that God is on a rescue mission to reestablish his loving reign and restore all things. Jesus Christ lived the faithful life that we should have lived. He died the guilty death we deserve to die. Then he rose to new life so that we could also be made alive with him. He is now enthroned over all things and will come again to overthrow evil completely, renew the cursed creation, and raise his people from the dead to enjoy living with him forever. Because he died for our sins, we can be forgiven and restored to find our joy in knowing God. “For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God” ( 1 Peter 3:18 ).\\nResponse: What We Must Do\\nThis gospel calls us to admit that we’re more sinful and flawed than we could ever believe, and yet, because of Christ, we’re more loved and welcomed than we could ever hope. We deserve the punishment of hell for our rebellion against God, and yet, because Christ took it, there is now no condemnation for those who trust him. None. Ever.

God filled the hearts of this small group of believers with a desire to see Him glorified in their lives in ways that they had not seen before. \\xa0“Now to Him who is able to do exceeding abundantly beyond all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us, to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. \\xa0Amen” (Ephesians 3:20-21).\\nIn the fall of that same year, as founding Elders, Bob VanKampen and Frank Yonke, secured the property at our present location on Galusha Avenue, and the “church” began to meet. The land had originally been owned by the McCormick family. A house had been built here for a nephew of Colonel Robert McCormick but, due to complications of various sorts, he never moved in and the house sat vacant for five years. It was in the family room of this house that GCD began its first public service in January, 1985.\\nEven before deciding on an official name, the people brought two specific prayer requests before the LORD:\\nWhat we now call the \"Fireside Room\" - 1988\\nThat they would rely on the Word of God completely (it was their desire that God would grow their love for His Word, acknowledging that it is inspired by Him and without error in its original documents, and making a commitment to use Scripture as their authoritative guide in all they would do in the life and conduct of the church).\\nThat they would rely on the power of God to save His elect (it was their prayer that a God-centered Gospel would not only be preached, but would also cause this body of believers to grow to maturity, to the measure of all the fullness of Christ (Ephesians 4:13]).\\nTherefore, it was on this foundational emphasis of the amazing Grace of God in salvation that Grace Church of DuPage (GCD) came into being—emphasizing the underserved mercy of God expressed to sinners in Christ Jesus. The use of DuPage in the church’s name was intended to reflect the desire to impact not only our local community, but the entire county.\\nAnother vision for the church during the earliest days was a focus on missions.\\nBecause of some personal, God-initiated relationships, GCD was excited by the work of The Master’s Mission (TMM), an organization whose aim was to train missionaries to take the gospel to the remotest areas of the world, and survive! \\xa0The work of TMM and reports of their work in Africa fanned the flame of gospel outreach in our own area and beyond. To date, outside the US, GCD supports mission efforts in Albania, Armenia, Czech Republic, Germany, India, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Philippines, Romania, and Ukraine.\\nThe GCD body has continued to grow in numbers as a result of reaching out to the community of Warrenville and beyond with events such as an annual, fall bonfire which came to be known as The Hallelujah Party and eventually the Fall Festival. \\xa0\\xa0Many people come and enjoy good food, the spirit of fellowship, and all that comes with it. \\xa0\\xa0God’s blessing has often been seen as He uses this event to draw some to Himself. \\xa0Other avenues of community outreach currently include, AWANA, Vacation Bible School, Celebration of Christmas concerts, Ladies’ Christmas Preview, golf outings, community service projects, Sports Ministry events, children’s activities at Warrenville Summer Daze, hosting the Warrenville Youth and Family Services’ Quest program targeting at-risk kids, and the list could continue on—many, many opportunities given by God to glorify Him through the proclamation of His saving grace.\\nIt is our intention to celebrate God’s grace and the blessing of his call to each of us to love and serve him here.\\nWhat God has accomplished since the founding of GCD is precisely the focus of this celebration. \\xa0It is not our intention to celebrate buildings or grounds or the lives of very fallen people. \\xa0As He leads us forward, let us join together as we remember and rejoice in all He has done in this place. Let us also embrace what lies ahead, trusting Him to lead and guide us for His glory and our good. In fact, let us ask, seek, and knock for God to develop us into a community of worshippers that bears much fruit as we live and proclaim the Gospel with authenticity and passion.\\nLeadership History\\n Sermons by Date by Scripture by Series by Speaker by Topic Index\\nBack\\nWelcome Gather With Us What We Believe About Us Elders, Deacons, and Staff Ask the Elders Contact Us Ministries All Ministries ➝ Adult Bible Fellowships Children & Nursery College & 20s Community Groups Giving Grace Biblical Counseling Global Outreach Local Outreach Men\\'s Ministry Music & Worship Opportunities to Serve Prayer RENEW Student Ministry Short-Term GO Teams Special Needs Sports Ministry Women\\'s Ministry Events Sermons Sermons by Date by Scripture by Series by Speaker by Topic Index Stream Give\\nWe exist to magnify the worth of God by exalting the Savior, equipping the saints and extending Christ\\'s kingdom.\\nGCD Family Resources Give Serve Directories Parent\\'s Corner Blog Great Doctrines Benevolence Subscribe to Emails Quest Mentoring Cars of Hope Library Books ➝ Forms Building & Grounds Reporting CCB Login ➝\\nA Biblical Model of Leadership\\nLike many Protestant Evangelical congregations, Grace Church of DuPage is overseen by Elders and served by Deacons.

The compound Greek word behind “servants” literally means “under-rowers,” calling to mind the team of men that moved ships with oars in pre-industrial times. They work together in almost synonymous harmony to achieve a purpose—the shepherding and teaching of God’s people—which no one of them could have accomplished on his own. A “steward” is one who has been entrusted with the care of someone else’s property. Church leaders, according to Paul, are “stewards of the mysteries of God,” the wide-ranging truths of the gospel that can be known only because God in His grace as revealed them.\\nIn essence, this is how we perceive our leaders at Grace Church: servants of God,\\xa0and stewards on our behalf of the mysteries of God. And we describe our responsibility using the words of the writer of Hebrews:\\n“Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you”\\n— Hebrews 13:17\\nElders\\nElders are responsible for the shepherding and the spiritual oversight of the body. \\xa0This begins with the priorities of Elders as outlined in Acts 20:28-35.\\nMeet Our Elders ➝\\nDeacons\\nThe Deacons shall consist of Grace Church members possessing the qualifications described in 1 Timothy 3:8-13. They shall be servants to the Church as they assist the Elders in the ministry of service to the Church body, which may include the overall responsibility for the general physical care of the Church facilities; for the Sunday School administrative duties; for the day to day financial oversight; and for any other duties as may be assigned to them by the Elders, from time to time.\\nMeet the Deacons ➝\\nPastoral Staff\\nFor some larger ministries, the Elders have determined that it is necessary for the shepherding and oversight of that ministry to be done by a full-time pastoral staff member. The Elders have searched for biblically qualified and gifted men to fill these roles.\\n Sermons by Date by Scripture by Series by Speaker by Topic Index\\nBack\\nWelcome Gather With Us What We Believe About Us Elders, Deacons, and Staff Ask the Elders Contact Us Ministries All Ministries ➝ Adult Bible Fellowships Children & Nursery College & 20s Community Groups Giving Grace Biblical Counseling Global Outreach Local Outreach Men\\'s Ministry Music & Worship Opportunities to Serve Prayer RENEW Student Ministry Short-Term GO Teams Special Needs Sports Ministry Women\\'s Ministry Events Sermons Sermons by Date by Scripture by Series by Speaker by Topic Index Stream Give\\nWe exist to magnify the worth of God by exalting the Savior, equipping the saints and extending Christ\\'s kingdom.\\nGCD Family Resources Give Serve Directories Parent\\'s Corner Blog Great Doctrines Benevolence Subscribe to Emails Quest Mentoring Cars of Hope Library Books ➝ Forms Building & Grounds Reporting CCB Login ➝\\nPastoral Ministries\\nWhat we believe the Bible teaches about the vision and aim for pastoral ministry in the local church and how that vision is applied in our specific context at Grace Church of DuPage.\\nAbout\\nIn his first century letter to the Ephesians, chapter four, the Apostle Paul laid out a clear vision for the aim pastoral ministry in the local church (Ephesians 4:11-16 ESV):\\nJesus Christ “ ...gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes. Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.”\\nDefined & Applied\\nWhat does this mean? In summary, the exercise of certain God-given gifts within the fellowship of the local Christian community enables believers to grow together toward spiritual maturity, stability, unity, and love as they serve God and one another toward an ever-deepening understanding of and engagement in the truths of the Christian faith.\\nThat is what pastoral ministry is supposed to produce: mature Christ-followers who love one another and are active in service together. And the pastoral ministry portion of the list of gifts Paul enumerated in Ephesians 4:11 are the last two items: “shepherds and teachers.”\\nTEACHERS\\n“Teachers” we understand: they explain biblical truth, theology, missions training, even biblical counseling and principles of discipleship in practical areas like personal holiness, marriage, family, parenting, and so forth, using trusted resources that are rooted in Scripture and expressive of sound doctrine.\\nSHEPHERDS\\n“Shepherds” is the interesting word. It is sometimes translated “pastors.” Pastors feed and care for God’s people, the “flock,” in a ways that are analogous to shepherds tending sheep. God does not want His people to be sheep without a shepherd (see Ezekiel 34). Therefore, Paul is telling us in Ephesians 4 that He has uniquely equipped certain people in the church to serve as “shepherds” so that His people will have the sort of teaching and leadership and care that He has intended for them. And as the shepherd’s operate within that enabling God supplies, His people mature in community just as He has intended.\\nAPPLICATION\\nAt Grace Church of DuPage we take pastoral ministry very seriously. Biblical teaching happens not only in our Sunday Worship Services, but also within the context of personal relationships in our Sunday morning Adult Bible Fellowships,\\xa0Youth Ministry, and Children’s Sunday School,\\xa0Wednesday Evening Lessons & Prayer and AWANA Clubs for children, our weekly/monthly FLOCKS gatherings in people’s homes, and also in our various types of and Small Groups, including Ladies Bible Study,\\xa0Ladies Prayer, and Men’s Small Groups.\\nCaring for one another at Grace Church also happens in different ways. As there are physical needs in the our body, our Care and Share ministry springs into action. And our Deacons can assist at times of financial need as they steward our Benevolence Fund. Our Grace Biblical Counseling Ministry is available for Pre-marriage and Marriage Counseling as well as Biblical Counseling regarding a wide range of personal issues. Our staff also provides Pastoral Counseling as requested. And when we lose loved ones, our Bereavement Ministry can help in some limited, but very tangible ways.\\nGrace Church is also forward-looking in areas of pastoral ministry, providing training and practical experience in a number of different ways through our Elder Preparation Program,\\xa0Pastoral Ministry Training Apprenticeship, Women’s Ministry Training Apprenticeship, Music Ministry Training Apprenticeship, and our Missionary Preparation Program.\\n Sermons by Date by Scripture by Series by Speaker by Topic Index\\nBack\\nWelcome Gather With Us What We Believe About Us Elders, Deacons, and Staff Ask the Elders Contact Us Ministries All Ministries ➝ Adult Bible Fellowships Children & Nursery College & 20s Community Groups Giving Grace Biblical Counseling Global Outreach Local Outreach Men\\'s Ministry Music & Worship Opportunities to Serve Prayer RENEW Student Ministry Short-Term GO Teams Special Needs Sports Ministry Women\\'s Ministry Events Sermons Sermons by Date by Scripture by Series by Speaker by Topic Index Stream Give\\nWe exist to magnify the worth of God by exalting the Savior, equipping the saints and extending Christ\\'s kingdom.\\nGCD Family Resources Give Serve Directories Parent\\'s Corner Blog Great Doctrines Benevolence Subscribe to Emails Quest Mentoring Cars of Hope Library Books ➝ Forms Building & Grounds Reporting CCB Login ➝\\nWho Is Jesus\\nThe message of Christianity is about God, the World, and you and me.\\xa0 It\\'s the story to which all other stories point.\\xa0 It is about the meaning of life, the search for joy, and hope in the face of death. It explains why we were created and what’s wrong with us. It explains why this world is so messed up and what God is doing to fix it. It is about the turning point of history: when a Jewish man from Nazareth walked out of his own tomb alive 2,000 years ago. And it’s about how that day marked the beginning of the renewal of all things.\\nCreation: The World As It Should Be\\nGod created the world and everything in it in order to put himself – his goodness, beauty, love, and wisdom – on display for us to enjoy. As our maker, he is our loving and trustworthy ruler who owns us and provides for all our needs. We were made to know him joyfully and to rule the world under his authority.\\nRebellion: What Went Wrong\\nAlthough God created all things good, the world is in shambles because we rejected him and his rule. Our first parents, Adam and Eve, were rebels and didn’t trust God. Because of this, God cursed the whole world and sent them away from his presence. We all live for our glory instead of God’s and we treasure the things God gives us while rejecting him as the gracious giver. Sometimes we try to add a little religion to our lives to offset our guilt, but we can’t fix our problem. God is dishonored and we are miserable. “For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him” ( Romans 1:23 ).\\nRedemption: What God Does For Us\\nBut God, because of his great grace, lovingly refuses to give us what we deserve. The gospel is the good news that God is on a rescue mission to reestablish his loving reign and restore all things. Jesus Christ lived the faithful life that we should have lived. He died the guilty death we deserve to die. Then he rose to new life so that we could also be made alive with him. He is now enthroned over all things and will come again to overthrow evil completely, renew the cursed creation, and raise his people from the dead to enjoy living with him forever. Because he died for our sins, we can be forgiven and restored to find our joy in knowing God. “For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God” ( 1 Peter 3:18 ).\\nResponse: What We Must Do\\nThis gospel calls us to admit that we’re more sinful and flawed than we could ever believe, and yet, because of Christ, we’re more loved and welcomed than we could ever hope. We deserve the punishment of hell for our rebellion against God, and yet, because Christ took it, there is now no condemnation for those who trust him. None. Ever. This means we must turn away from our rebellious disobedience as well as our prideful obedience. We let go of our bad works and our good works and trust only in Christ’s work. “To all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God” ( John 1:12 ).\\nWill you receive Jesus Christ and rejoice in his work for you? “We also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation” ( Romans 5:11 ).\\n Sermons by Date by Scripture by Series by Speaker by Topic Index\\nBack\\nWelcome Gather With Us What We Believe About Us Elders, Deacons, and Staff Ask the Elders Contact Us Ministries All Ministries ➝ Adult Bible Fellowships Children & Nursery College & 20s Community Groups Giving Grace Biblical Counseling Global Outreach Local Outreach Men\\'s Ministry Music & Worship Opportunities to Serve Prayer RENEW Student Ministry Short-Term GO Teams Special Needs Sports Ministry Women\\'s Ministry Events Sermons Sermons by Date by Scripture by Series by Speaker by Topic Index Stream Give\\nWe exist to magnify the worth of God by exalting the Savior, equipping the saints and extending Christ\\'s kingdom.\\nOur Purpose, Vision, and Values\\nOur Purpose\\nWe exist to magnify the worth of God by exalting our Savior, equipping the saints, and extending Christ\\'s kingdom.\\nHow are we seeking god to carry out this purpose in us?\\nWe encourage you seek the Lord and his leading and as we do that together, we ask you to commit to involvement in one of each of of these areas: corporate worship, small gathering, in-church service, and outreach.\\nCORPORATE WORSHIP\\nTo experience God’s presence and work, hear his welcome and word, and respond with worship, prayer, and thanksgiving.\\nAnd they devoted themselves to the apostles\\' teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers.

But unlike many such congregations, we have labored to define these roles according to Scripture. Several passages in the Bible inform the office and operation of Elders and Deacons, including their character qualifications (1 Timothy 3:1-13; Titus 1:5-9), their responsibilities in the body (1 Peter 5:1-4; Acts 20:28), and the nature of the authority they wield (Hebrews 13:17) as gifted and called servants of God and His church (Ephesians 4:11-16).\\n Download Baptism & Membership Application ➝\\nMembership Induction at Grace Church of DuPage\\nThe following is the pattern developed in our Constitution by our Elders,\\xa0that the Membership induction service follows. \\xa0Covenantal questions are read aloud, and candidates for Membership respond aloud before God and the congregation with a hearty \"I do\". \\xa0Then, current Members and candidates recite aloud in unison the Church Covenant. \\xa0Finally, the pastor closes us in prayer.\\nPastoral Exhortation and Excerpt from the Constitution on Membership\\nThe pastor reads an excerpt from the GCD Constitution re: the purpose of Membership and gives words of encouragement to current Members and candidates about the significance of being a Member of a local congregation.\\xa0 He also reminds everyone about the benefits of Membership such as expanded ministry opportunities, increased commitment and accountability, along with the protection and leadership of qualified Church Elders. Finally, he states our thanks to God for them and their desire to commit to the worship, fellowship, and service within our own local assembly of believers.\\nCovenantal Questions\\nThe candidates will respond with a hearty “ I do” to each of these questions.\\nDo you confess Jesus Christ as your Savior and Lord?\\nDo you accept the Holy Scriptures, the Old and New Testaments, as the authoritative and infallible Word of God?\\nDo you commit to live among God’s faithful people by hearing His Word, sharing His Supper, and proclaiming,\\xa0through your words and deeds, the good news of salvation by God’s grace through faith in Christ?\\nDo you also promise to support the ministries of this Church with your prayers, your presence, your participation,\\xa0and your provision as God would permit?\\nChurch Covenant Recited in Unison by Current Members and Candidates\\nHaving been led by the Spirit of God to receive Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord, and having made public confession of our faith through Baptism to show our identification with Christ; we freely and joyfully enter into a Covenant with one another as one body in Christ, seeking the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.\\nWe pledge, therefore, by the aid of God’s Spirit, to live together in Christian love by exercising an affectionate care and watchfulness over one another, and faithfully encouraging and admonishing one another in the faith. We will rejoice with each other’s joys and bear one another’s burdens with tenderness and grace.\\nWe pledge to work for the advancement of God’s kingdom through His Church by the spiritual disciplines of the Word, prayer, evangelism, worship, and fellowship. We also promise to sustain its Ordinances and doctrines, and to support its ministry by a faithful stewardship of our money through cheerful and regular giving, and with the devoted use of our time and giftedness; thus to spread the Gospel through all the nations.\\nWe further pledge to follow Christian principles of morality in our daily lives; being ethical in our dealings and faithful in our commitments, and denying ungodliness and worldly lusts in our pursuit of holy living.

God filled the hearts of this small group of believers with a desire to see Him glorified in their lives in ways that they had not seen before. \\xa0“Now to Him who is able to do exceeding abundantly beyond all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us, to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. \\xa0Amen” (Ephesians 3:20-21).\\nIn the fall of that same year, as founding Elders, Bob VanKampen and Frank Yonke, secured the property at our present location on Galusha Avenue, and the “church” began to meet. The land had originally been owned by the McCormick family. A house had been built here for a nephew of Colonel Robert McCormick but, due to complications of various sorts, he never moved in and the house sat vacant for five years. It was in the family room of this house that GCD began its first public service in January, 1985.\\nEven before deciding on an official name, the people brought two specific prayer requests before the LORD:\\nWhat we now call the \"Fireside Room\" - 1988\\nThat they would rely on the Word of God completely (it was their desire that God would grow their love for His Word, acknowledging that it is inspired by Him and without error in its original documents, and making a commitment to use Scripture as their authoritative guide in all they would do in the life and conduct of the church).\\nThat they would rely on the power of God to save His elect (it was their prayer that a God-centered Gospel would not only be preached, but would also cause this body of believers to grow to maturity, to the measure of all the fullness of Christ (Ephesians 4:13]).\\nTherefore, it was on this foundational emphasis of the amazing Grace of God in salvation that Grace Church of DuPage (GCD) came into being—emphasizing the underserved mercy of God expressed to sinners in Christ Jesus. The use of DuPage in the church’s name was intended to reflect the desire to impact not only our local community, but the entire county.\\nAnother vision for the church during the earliest days was a focus on missions.\\nBecause of some personal, God-initiated relationships, GCD was excited by the work of The Master’s Mission (TMM), an organization whose aim was to train missionaries to take the gospel to the remotest areas of the world, and survive! \\xa0The work of TMM and reports of their work in Africa fanned the flame of gospel outreach in our own area and beyond. To date, outside the US, GCD supports mission efforts in Albania, Armenia, Czech Republic, Germany, India, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Philippines, Romania, and Ukraine.\\nThe GCD body has continued to grow in numbers as a result of reaching out to the community of Warrenville and beyond with events such as an annual, fall bonfire which came to be known as The Hallelujah Party and eventually the Fall Festival. \\xa0\\xa0Many people come and enjoy good food, the spirit of fellowship, and all that comes with it. \\xa0\\xa0God’s blessing has often been seen as He uses this event to draw some to Himself. \\xa0Other avenues of community outreach currently include, AWANA, Vacation Bible School, Celebration of Christmas concerts, Ladies’ Christmas Preview, golf outings, community service projects, Sports Ministry events, children’s activities at Warrenville Summer Daze, hosting the Warrenville Youth and Family Services’ Quest program targeting at-risk kids, and the list could continue on—many, many opportunities given by God to glorify Him through the proclamation of His saving grace.\\nIt is our intention to celebrate God’s grace and the blessing of his call to each of us to love and serve him here.\\nWhat God has accomplished since the founding of GCD is precisely the focus of this celebration. \\xa0It is not our intention to celebrate buildings or grounds or the lives of very fallen people. \\xa0As He leads us forward, let us join together as we remember and rejoice in all He has done in this place. Let us also embrace what lies ahead, trusting Him to lead and guide us for His glory and our good. In fact, let us ask, seek, and knock for God to develop us into a community of worshippers that bears much fruit as we live and proclaim the Gospel with authenticity and passion.\\nLeadership History\\n Sermons by Date by Scripture by Series by Speaker by Topic Index\\nBack\\nWelcome Gather With Us What We Believe About Us Elders, Deacons, and Staff Ask the Elders Contact Us Ministries All Ministries ➝ Adult Bible Fellowships Children & Nursery College & 20s Community Groups Giving Grace Biblical Counseling Global Outreach Local Outreach Men\\'s Ministry Music & Worship Opportunities to Serve Prayer RENEW Student Ministry Short-Term GO Teams Special Needs Sports Ministry Women\\'s Ministry Events Sermons Sermons by Date by Scripture by Series by Speaker by Topic Index Stream Give\\nWe exist to magnify the worth of God by exalting the Savior, equipping the saints and extending Christ\\'s kingdom.\\nGCD Family Resources Give Serve Directories Parent\\'s Corner Blog Great Doctrines Benevolence Subscribe to Emails Quest Mentoring Cars of Hope Library Books ➝ Forms Building & Grounds Reporting CCB Login ➝\\nA Biblical Model of Leadership\\nLike many Protestant Evangelical congregations, Grace Church of DuPage is overseen by Elders and served by Deacons.

The compound Greek word behind “servants” literally means “under-rowers,” calling to mind the team of men that moved ships with oars in pre-industrial times. They work together in almost synonymous harmony to achieve a purpose—the shepherding and teaching of God’s people—which no one of them could have accomplished on his own. A “steward” is one who has been entrusted with the care of someone else’s property. Church leaders, according to Paul, are “stewards of the mysteries of God,” the wide-ranging truths of the gospel that can be known only because God in His grace as revealed them.\\nIn essence, this is how we perceive our leaders at Grace Church: servants of God,\\xa0and stewards on our behalf of the mysteries of God. And we describe our responsibility using the words of the writer of Hebrews:\\n“Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you”\\n— Hebrews 13:17\\nElders\\nElders are responsible for the shepherding and the spiritual oversight of the body. \\xa0This begins with the priorities of Elders as outlined in Acts 20:28-35.\\nMeet Our Elders ➝\\nDeacons\\nThe Deacons shall consist of Grace Church members possessing the qualifications described in 1 Timothy 3:8-13. They shall be servants to the Church as they assist the Elders in the ministry of service to the Church body, which may include the overall responsibility for the general physical care of the Church facilities; for the Sunday School administrative duties; for the day to day financial oversight; and for any other duties as may be assigned to them by the Elders, from time to time.\\nMeet the Deacons ➝\\nPastoral Staff\\nFor some larger ministries, the Elders have determined that it is necessary for the shepherding and oversight of that ministry to be done by a full-time pastoral staff member. The Elders have searched for biblically qualified and gifted men to fill these roles.\\n Sermons by Date by Scripture by Series by Speaker by Topic Index\\nBack\\nWelcome Gather With Us What We Believe About Us Elders, Deacons, and Staff Ask the Elders Contact Us Ministries All Ministries ➝ Adult Bible Fellowships Children & Nursery College & 20s Community Groups Giving Grace Biblical Counseling Global Outreach Local Outreach Men\\'s Ministry Music & Worship Opportunities to Serve Prayer RENEW Student Ministry Short-Term GO Teams Special Needs Sports Ministry Women\\'s Ministry Events Sermons Sermons by Date by Scripture by Series by Speaker by Topic Index Stream Give\\nWe exist to magnify the worth of God by exalting the Savior, equipping the saints and extending Christ\\'s kingdom.\\nGCD Family Resources Give Serve Directories Parent\\'s Corner Blog Great Doctrines Benevolence Subscribe to Emails Quest Mentoring Cars of Hope Library Books ➝ Forms Building & Grounds Reporting CCB Login ➝\\nPastoral Ministries\\nWhat we believe the Bible teaches about the vision and aim for pastoral ministry in the local church and how that vision is applied in our specific context at Grace Church of DuPage.\\nAbout\\nIn his first century letter to the Ephesians, chapter four, the Apostle Paul laid out a clear vision for the aim pastoral ministry in the local church (Ephesians 4:11-16 ESV):\\nJesus Christ “ ...gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes. Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.”\\nDefined & Applied\\nWhat does this mean? In summary, the exercise of certain God-given gifts within the fellowship of the local Christian community enables believers to grow together toward spiritual maturity, stability, unity, and love as they serve God and one another toward an ever-deepening understanding of and engagement in the truths of the Christian faith.\\nThat is what pastoral ministry is supposed to produce: mature Christ-followers who love one another and are active in service together. And the pastoral ministry portion of the list of gifts Paul enumerated in Ephesians 4:11 are the last two items: “shepherds and teachers.”\\nTEACHERS\\n“Teachers” we understand: they explain biblical truth, theology, missions training, even biblical counseling and principles of discipleship in practical areas like personal holiness, marriage, family, parenting, and so forth, using trusted resources that are rooted in Scripture and expressive of sound doctrine.\\nSHEPHERDS\\n“Shepherds” is the interesting word. It is sometimes translated “pastors.” Pastors feed and care for God’s people, the “flock,” in a ways that are analogous to shepherds tending sheep. God does not want His people to be sheep without a shepherd (see Ezekiel 34). Therefore, Paul is telling us in Ephesians 4 that He has uniquely equipped certain people in the church to serve as “shepherds” so that His people will have the sort of teaching and leadership and care that He has intended for them. And as the shepherd’s operate within that enabling God supplies, His people mature in community just as He has intended.\\nAPPLICATION\\nAt Grace Church of DuPage we take pastoral ministry very seriously. Biblical teaching happens not only in our Sunday Worship Services, but also within the context of personal relationships in our Sunday morning Adult Bible Fellowships,\\xa0Youth Ministry, and Children’s Sunday School,\\xa0Wednesday Evening Lessons & Prayer and AWANA Clubs for children, our weekly/monthly FLOCKS gatherings in people’s homes, and also in our various types of and Small Groups, including Ladies Bible Study,\\xa0Ladies Prayer, and Men’s Small Groups.\\nCaring for one another at Grace Church also happens in different ways. As there are physical needs in the our body, our Care and Share ministry springs into action. And our Deacons can assist at times of financial need as they steward our Benevolence Fund. Our Grace Biblical Counseling Ministry is available for Pre-marriage and Marriage Counseling as well as Biblical Counseling regarding a wide range of personal issues. Our staff also provides Pastoral Counseling as requested. And when we lose loved ones, our Bereavement Ministry can help in some limited, but very tangible ways.\\nGrace Church is also forward-looking in areas of pastoral ministry, providing training and practical experience in a number of different ways through our Elder Preparation Program,\\xa0Pastoral Ministry Training Apprenticeship, Women’s Ministry Training Apprenticeship, Music Ministry Training Apprenticeship, and our Missionary Preparation Program.\\n Sermons by Date by Scripture by Series by Speaker by Topic Index\\nBack\\nWelcome Gather With Us What We Believe About Us Elders, Deacons, and Staff Ask the Elders Contact Us Ministries All Ministries ➝ Adult Bible Fellowships Children & Nursery College & 20s Community Groups Giving Grace Biblical Counseling Global Outreach Local Outreach Men\\'s Ministry Music & Worship Opportunities to Serve Prayer RENEW Student Ministry Short-Term GO Teams Special Needs Sports Ministry Women\\'s Ministry Events Sermons Sermons by Date by Scripture by Series by Speaker by Topic Index Stream Give\\nWe exist to magnify the worth of God by exalting the Savior, equipping the saints and extending Christ\\'s kingdom.\\nGCD Family Resources Give Serve Directories Parent\\'s Corner Blog Great Doctrines Benevolence Subscribe to Emails Quest Mentoring Cars of Hope Library Books ➝ Forms Building & Grounds Reporting CCB Login ➝\\nWho Is Jesus\\nThe message of Christianity is about God, the World, and you and me.\\xa0 It\\'s the story to which all other stories point.\\xa0 It is about the meaning of life, the search for joy, and hope in the face of death. It explains why we were created and what’s wrong with us. It explains why this world is so messed up and what God is doing to fix it. It is about the turning point of history: when a Jewish man from Nazareth walked out of his own tomb alive 2,000 years ago. And it’s about how that day marked the beginning of the renewal of all things.\\nCreation: The World As It Should Be\\nGod created the world and everything in it in order to put himself – his goodness, beauty, love, and wisdom – on display for us to enjoy. As our maker, he is our loving and trustworthy ruler who owns us and provides for all our needs. We were made to know him joyfully and to rule the world under his authority.\\nRebellion: What Went Wrong\\nAlthough God created all things good, the world is in shambles because we rejected him and his rule. Our first parents, Adam and Eve, were rebels and didn’t trust God. Because of this, God cursed the whole world and sent them away from his presence. We all live for our glory instead of God’s and we treasure the things God gives us while rejecting him as the gracious giver. Sometimes we try to add a little religion to our lives to offset our guilt, but we can’t fix our problem. God is dishonored and we are miserable. “For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him” ( Romans 1:23 ).\\nRedemption: What God Does For Us\\nBut God, because of his great grace, lovingly refuses to give us what we deserve. The gospel is the good news that God is on a rescue mission to reestablish his loving reign and restore all things. Jesus Christ lived the faithful life that we should have lived. He died the guilty death we deserve to die. Then he rose to new life so that we could also be made alive with him. He is now enthroned over all things and will come again to overthrow evil completely, renew the cursed creation, and raise his people from the dead to enjoy living with him forever. Because he died for our sins, we can be forgiven and restored to find our joy in knowing God. “For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God” ( 1 Peter 3:18 ).\\nResponse: What We Must Do\\nThis gospel calls us to admit that we’re more sinful and flawed than we could ever believe, and yet, because of Christ, we’re more loved and welcomed than we could ever hope. We deserve the punishment of hell for our rebellion against God, and yet, because Christ took it, there is now no condemnation for those who trust him. None. Ever. This means we must turn away from our rebellious disobedience as well as our prideful obedience. We let go of our bad works and our good works and trust only in Christ’s work. “To all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God” ( John 1:12 ).\\nWill you receive Jesus Christ and rejoice in his work for you? “We also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation” ( Romans 5:11 ).\\n Sermons by Date by Scripture by Series by Speaker by Topic Index\\nBack\\nWelcome Gather With Us What We Believe About Us Elders, Deacons, and Staff Ask the Elders Contact Us Ministries All Ministries ➝ Adult Bible Fellowships Children & Nursery College & 20s Community Groups Giving Grace Biblical Counseling Global Outreach Local Outreach Men\\'s Ministry Music & Worship Opportunities to Serve Prayer RENEW Student Ministry Short-Term GO Teams Special Needs Sports Ministry Women\\'s Ministry Events Sermons Sermons by Date by Scripture by Series by Speaker by Topic Index Stream Give\\nWe exist to magnify the worth of God by exalting the Savior, equipping the saints and extending Christ\\'s kingdom.\\nOur Purpose, Vision, and Values\\nOur Purpose\\nWe exist to magnify the worth of God by exalting our Savior, equipping the saints, and extending Christ\\'s kingdom.\\nHow are we seeking god to carry out this purpose in us?\\nWe encourage you seek the Lord and his leading and as we do that together, we ask you to commit to involvement in one of each of of these areas: corporate worship, small gathering, in-church service, and outreach.\\nCORPORATE WORSHIP\\nTo experience God’s presence and work, hear his welcome and word, and respond with worship, prayer, and thanksgiving.\\nAnd they devoted themselves to the apostles\\' teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers.

But unlike many such congregations, we have labored to define these roles according to Scripture. Several passages in the Bible inform the office and operation of Elders and Deacons, including their character qualifications (1 Timothy 3:1-13; Titus 1:5-9), their responsibilities in the body (1 Peter 5:1-4; Acts 20:28), and the nature of the authority they wield (Hebrews 13:17) as gifted and called servants of God and His church (Ephesians 4:11-16).\\n Download Baptism & Membership Application ➝\\nMembership Induction at Grace Church of DuPage\\nThe following is the pattern developed in our Constitution by our Elders,\\xa0that the Membership induction service follows. \\xa0Covenantal questions are read aloud, and candidates for Membership respond aloud before God and the congregation with a hearty \"I do\". \\xa0Then, current Members and candidates recite aloud in unison the Church Covenant. \\xa0Finally, the pastor closes us in prayer.\\nPastoral Exhortation and Excerpt from the Constitution on Membership\\nThe pastor reads an excerpt from the GCD Constitution re: the purpose of Membership and gives words of encouragement to current Members and candidates about the significance of being a Member of a local congregation.\\xa0 He also reminds everyone about the benefits of Membership such as expanded ministry opportunities, increased commitment and accountability, along with the protection and leadership of qualified Church Elders.

We will rejoice with each other’s joys and bear one another’s burdens with tenderness and grace.\\nWe pledge to work for the advancement of God’s kingdom through His Church by the spiritual disciplines of the Word, prayer, evangelism, worship, and fellowship. We also promise to sustain its Ordinances and doctrines, and to support its ministry by a faithful stewardship of our money through cheerful and regular giving, and with the devoted use of our time and giftedness; thus to spread the Gospel through all the nations.\\nWe further pledge to follow Christian principles of morality in our daily lives; being ethical in our dealings and faithful in our commitments, and denying ungodliness and worldly lusts in our pursuit of holy living.

God filled the hearts of this small group of believers with a desire to see Him glorified in their lives in ways that they had not seen before. \\xa0“Now to Him who is able to do exceeding abundantly beyond all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us, to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. \\xa0Amen” (Ephesians 3:20-21).\\nIn the fall of that same year, as founding Elders, Bob VanKampen and Frank Yonke, secured the property at our present location on Galusha Avenue, and the “church” began to meet. The land had originally been owned by the McCormick family. A house had been built here for a nephew of Colonel Robert McCormick but, due to complications of various sorts, he never moved in and the house sat vacant for five years. It was in the family room of this house that GCD began its first public service in January, 1985.\\nEven before deciding on an official name, the people brought two specific prayer requests before the LORD:\\nWhat we now call the \"Fireside Room\" - 1988\\nThat they would rely on the Word of God completely (it was their desire that God would grow their love for His Word, acknowledging that it is inspired by Him and without error in its original documents, and making a commitment to use Scripture as their authoritative guide in all they would do in the life and conduct of the church).\\nThat they would rely on the power of God to save His elect (it was their prayer that a God-centered Gospel would not only be preached, but would also cause this body of believers to grow to maturity, to the measure of all the fullness of Christ (Ephesians 4:13]).\\nTherefore, it was on this foundational emphasis of the amazing Grace of God in salvation that Grace Church of DuPage (GCD) came into being—emphasizing the underserved mercy of God expressed to sinners in Christ Jesus. The use of DuPage in the church’s name was intended to reflect the desire to impact not only our local community, but the entire county.\\nAnother vision for the church during the earliest days was a focus on missions.\\nBecause of some personal, God-initiated relationships, GCD was excited by the work of The Master’s Mission (TMM), an organization whose aim was to train missionaries to take the gospel to the remotest areas of the world, and survive! \\xa0The work of TMM and reports of their work in Africa fanned the flame of gospel outreach in our own area and beyond. To date, outside the US, GCD supports mission efforts in Albania, Armenia, Czech Republic, Germany, India, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Philippines, Romania, and Ukraine.\\nThe GCD body has continued to grow in numbers as a result of reaching out to the community of Warrenville and beyond with events such as an annual, fall bonfire which came to be known as The Hallelujah Party and eventually the Fall Festival. \\xa0\\xa0Many people come and enjoy good food, the spirit of fellowship, and all that comes with it. \\xa0\\xa0God’s blessing has often been seen as He uses this event to draw some to Himself. \\xa0Other avenues of community outreach currently include, AWANA, Vacation Bible School, Celebration of Christmas concerts, Ladies’ Christmas Preview, golf outings, community service projects, Sports Ministry events, children’s activities at Warrenville Summer Daze, hosting the Warrenville Youth and Family Services’ Quest program targeting at-risk kids, and the list could continue on—many, many opportunities given by God to glorify Him through the proclamation of His saving grace.\\nIt is our intention to celebrate God’s grace and the blessing of his call to each of us to love and serve him here.\\nWhat God has accomplished since the founding of GCD is precisely the focus of this celebration. \\xa0It is not our intention to celebrate buildings or grounds or the lives of very fallen people. \\xa0As He leads us forward, let us join together as we remember and rejoice in all He has done in this place. Let us also embrace what lies ahead, trusting Him to lead and guide us for His glory and our good. In fact, let us ask, seek, and knock for God to develop us into a community of worshippers that bears much fruit as we live and proclaim the Gospel with authenticity and passion.\\nLeadership History\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.6691751237081842, 'meta': {'url': 'https://www.gracedupage.org/history', 'timestamp': 1697085018, 'vector_id': '0'}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': '<embedding of shape (768,)>', 'id': '387fbf3c6f3e17c261aa08b41b5a1f4a'}>,\n",

The compound Greek word behind “servants” literally means “under-rowers,” calling to mind the team of men that moved ships with oars in pre-industrial times. They work together in almost synonymous harmony to achieve a purpose—the shepherding and teaching of God’s people—which no one of them could have accomplished on his own. A “steward” is one who has been entrusted with the care of someone else’s property. Church leaders, according to Paul, are “stewards of the mysteries of God,” the wide-ranging truths of the gospel that can be known only because God in His grace as revealed them.\\nIn essence, this is how we perceive our leaders at Grace Church: servants of God,\\xa0and stewards on our behalf of the mysteries of God. And we describe our responsibility using the words of the writer of Hebrews:\\n“Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you”\\n— Hebrews 13:17\\nElders\\nElders are responsible for the shepherding and the spiritual oversight of the body. \\xa0This begins with the priorities of Elders as outlined in Acts 20:28-35.\\nMeet Our Elders ➝\\nDeacons\\nThe Deacons shall consist of Grace Church members possessing the qualifications described in 1 Timothy 3:8-13. They shall be servants to the Church as they assist the Elders in the ministry of service to the Church body, which may include the overall responsibility for the general physical care of the Church facilities; for the Sunday School administrative duties; for the day to day financial oversight; and for any other duties as may be assigned to them by the Elders, from time to time.\\nMeet the Deacons ➝\\nPastoral Staff\\nFor some larger ministries, the Elders have determined that it is necessary for the shepherding and oversight of that ministry to be done by a full-time pastoral staff member. The Elders have searched for biblically qualified and gifted men to fill these roles.\\n\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.6642364146443062, 'meta': {'url': 'https://www.gracedupage.org/leadership', 'timestamp': 1697085019, 'vector_id': '5'}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': '<embedding of shape (768,)>', 'id': 'c76ee9bcae4bb2c2bd47296fefa0ad4a'}>,\n",

Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.”\\nDefined & Applied\\nWhat does this mean? In summary, the exercise of certain God-given gifts within the fellowship of the local Christian community enables believers to grow together toward spiritual maturity, stability, unity, and love as they serve God and one another toward an ever-deepening understanding of and engagement in the truths of the Christian faith.\\nThat is what pastoral ministry is supposed to produce: mature Christ-followers who love one another and are active in service together. And the pastoral ministry portion of the list of gifts Paul enumerated in Ephesians 4:11 are the last two items: “shepherds and teachers.”\\nTEACHERS\\n“Teachers” we understand: they explain biblical truth, theology, missions training, even biblical counseling and principles of discipleship in practical areas like personal holiness, marriage, family, parenting, and so forth, using trusted resources that are rooted in Scripture and expressive of sound doctrine.\\nSHEPHERDS\\n“Shepherds” is the interesting word. It is sometimes translated “pastors.” Pastors feed and care for God’s people, the “flock,” in a ways that are analogous to shepherds tending sheep. God does not want His people to be sheep without a shepherd (see Ezekiel 34). Therefore, Paul is telling us in Ephesians 4 that He has uniquely equipped certain people in the church to serve as “shepherds” so that His people will have the sort of teaching and leadership and care that He has intended for them. And as the shepherd’s operate within that enabling God supplies, His people mature in community just as He has intended.\\nAPPLICATION\\nAt Grace Church of DuPage we take pastoral ministry very seriously. Biblical teaching happens not only in our Sunday Worship Services, but also within the context of personal relationships in our Sunday morning Adult Bible Fellowships,\\xa0Youth Ministry, and Children’s Sunday School,\\xa0Wednesday Evening Lessons & Prayer and AWANA Clubs for children, our weekly/monthly FLOCKS gatherings in people’s homes, and also in our various types of and Small Groups, including Ladies Bible Study,\\xa0Ladies Prayer, and Men’s Small Groups.\\nCaring for one another at Grace Church also happens in different ways. As there are physical needs in the our body, our Care and Share ministry springs into action. And our Deacons can assist at times of financial need as they steward our Benevolence Fund. Our Grace Biblical Counseling Ministry is available for Pre-marriage and Marriage Counseling as well as Biblical Counseling regarding a wide range of personal issues. Our staff also provides Pastoral Counseling as requested. And when we lose loved ones, our Bereavement Ministry can help in some limited, but very tangible ways.\\nGrace Church is also forward-looking in areas of pastoral ministry, providing training and practical experience in a number of different ways through our Elder Preparation Program,\\xa0Pastoral Ministry Training Apprenticeship, Women’s Ministry Training Apprenticeship, Music Ministry Training Apprenticeship, and our Missionary Preparation Program.\\n\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.6625416189349265, 'meta': {'url': 'https://www.gracedupage.org/pastoral-ministries', 'timestamp': 1697085019, 'vector_id': '3'}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': '<embedding of shape (768,)>', 'id': 'aa16e70e066c17c15778ef504d0ddd57'}>,\n",

It explains why we were created and what’s wrong with us. It explains why this world is so messed up and what God is doing to fix it. It is about the turning point of history: when a Jewish man from Nazareth walked out of his own tomb alive 2,000 years ago. And it’s about how that day marked the beginning of the renewal of all things.\\nCreation: The World As It Should Be\\nGod created the world and everything in it in order to put himself – his goodness, beauty, love, and wisdom – on display for us to enjoy. As our maker, he is our loving and trustworthy ruler who owns us and provides for all our needs. We were made to know him joyfully and to rule the world under his authority.\\nRebellion: What Went Wrong\\nAlthough God created all things good, the world is in shambles because we rejected him and his rule. Our first parents, Adam and Eve, were rebels and didn’t trust God. Because of this, God cursed the whole world and sent them away from his presence. We all live for our glory instead of God’s and we treasure the things God gives us while rejecting him as the gracious giver. Sometimes we try to add a little religion to our lives to offset our guilt, but we can’t fix our problem. God is dishonored and we are miserable. “For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him” ( Romans 1:23 ).\\nRedemption: What God Does For Us\\nBut God, because of his great grace, lovingly refuses to give us what we deserve. The gospel is the good news that God is on a rescue mission to reestablish his loving reign and restore all things. Jesus Christ lived the faithful life that we should have lived. He died the guilty death we deserve to die. Then he rose to new life so that we could also be made alive with him. He is now enthroned over all things and will come again to overthrow evil completely, renew the cursed creation, and raise his people from the dead to enjoy living with him forever. Because he died for our sins, we can be forgiven and restored to find our joy in knowing God. “For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God” ( 1 Peter 3:18 ).\\nResponse: What We Must Do\\nThis gospel calls us to admit that we’re more sinful and flawed than we could ever believe, and yet, because of Christ, we’re more loved and welcomed than we could ever hope. We deserve the punishment of hell for our rebellion against God, and yet, because Christ took it, there is now no condemnation for those who trust him. None. Ever. This means we must turn away from our rebellious disobedience as well as our prideful obedience. We let go of our bad works and our good works and trust only in Christ’s work. “To all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God” ( John 1:12 ).\\nWill you receive Jesus Christ and rejoice in his work for you? “We also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation” ( Romans 5:11 ).\\n\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.6598004343837256, 'meta': {'url': 'https://www.gracedupage.org/who-is-jesus', 'timestamp': 1697085014, 'vector_id': '4'}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': '<embedding of shape (768,)>', 'id': 'ab8b274f1e6a53540a235245fc1dee6b'}>,\n",
